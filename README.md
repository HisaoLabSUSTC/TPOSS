# TPOSS

This is the repository for the paper: *Targeted Pareto Optimization for Subset Selection*

## Dataset

The whole dataset is avaliable at [TPOSS Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guotongwu/tposs-dataset), you can download all the `.mat` files and put them into `./data` folder.

## Algorithm

In the `./algorithm` folder, there are 5 algorithms, namely POSS, PORSS-U, PORSS-O, SPESS, and TPOSS. The original source code for POSS is accessible from [POSS Code](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/code_POSS.ashx), while the source code for both PORSS-U and PORSS-O can be found at [PROSS Code](http://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/qianc/code_porss.html). We extend our sincere gratitude to Prof. Lei Zhang, the author of SPESS, for generously sharing the source code of SPESS with us.

## Experimental Results

The experimental data, along with the figures and tables from the paper, are all located in the `./result` folder.
